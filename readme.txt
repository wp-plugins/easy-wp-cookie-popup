Wordpress Cookies Popup displays a customised, and translatable, popup notifying new visitors that your site uses cookies.

== Description ==

Wordpress Cookies Popup displays a fully-customised popup that notifies new visitors to your website that it uses cookies. This is great for those sites who now have to comply with the EU Cookie Law. Additionally, for those sites that want to use a simple, lightweight system to display a warning that the site uses cookies, Wordpress Cookies Popup is a handy tool that is both easy to use and feature-full.

= Only Display To New Visitors =
Wordpress Cookies Popup displays its notification only to new visitors to your site. A user doesn't have to accept your policy by clicking anywhere. If they stay on your site it is assumed they have read your cookies notification message, accept your cookie policy and therefore no longer need to see the cookie notification message. Using a simple piece of javascript, Wordpress Cookies Popup will only display to new visitors or visitors who have cleared their cookies since last visiting.

= Translate Your Wordpress Cookie Notification Message =
Wordpress Cookies Popup allows you to translate your cookies notification message into as many languages as your choose. At the moment, the plugin is only compatible with <a href="http://wpml.org/">WPML</a> but there is no better multi-language system you can use on your site. Simply install both plugins, activate them both and you'll instantly see how to offer your cookie notification in every language you offer your content in. Easy!

== Installation ==

The plugin is simple to install:

1. Download 'wordpress-cookies-popup.zip'
1. Unzip
1. Upload 'wordpress-cookies-popup' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins' directory
1. Go to the plugin management page and enable the Wordpress Cookies Popup
1. Browse to Settings > Cookie Notification
1. Customise the position, title and cookie notification message for your Wordpress site.
